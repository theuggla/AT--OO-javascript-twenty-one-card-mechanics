# Adventures in Javascript
Javascript modules for card players and a deck. Cards and deck are separate, player and dealer written for twenty-one card game.

Mostly an exercise in writing object-oriented code in Javascript without using syntactic sugar such as `class`. In addition also an 
exercise in writing tests in Mocha.
