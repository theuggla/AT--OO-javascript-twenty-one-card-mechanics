To recieve offline notifications you will have to allow notifications from the site as well activate them when logged in. If you are the first user on your computer, the site will ask you to allow notifications when you activate. If another user of the site on the same computer has previously disallowed notifications, you will have to change the notification settings on the site by clocking the padlock to the left of the url and allowing notifications.

The application is availiable for adding to your homescreen on an android phone, and will then push notifications to your phone as well.
